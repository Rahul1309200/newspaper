        <center><img class="img" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/11/multimedia/11dc-ukraine-weapons-gkqm/11dc-ukraine-weapons-gkqm-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp" alt="">
    <pre>     Despite billions of dollars in additional weapons and security
            assistance that NATO announced this week, allied officials said
            Ukraine would not be ready to launch a dramatic counteroffensive
            or retake large swaths of territory from Russia until next year. 

            Donations of missiles, combat vehicles, ammunition and air defenses
            from the United States and European countries will take weeks, if
            not months, to reach the front lines. 
            
            Some of the newly committed weapons have not yet been bought or built. 
            
            Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said long-anticipated F-16s fighter
            jets would be delivered to Ukraine this summer. But even then, they might
            be used mostly defensively, as allies debated on the sidelines of the NATO
            summit in Washington whether the warplanes could fly into Russian airspace to attack. 
            
            “On many occasions, you could see that we can decide, but unfortunately we cannot deliver
            efficiently,” President Gitanas Nauseda of Lithuania said in a brief interview on Wednesday. 
            “This is a huge disappointment for me personally, because Ukrainians are expecting that 
            those goods will come, this military equipment will reach Ukraine, but it's not happening.”

    <pre>For their anniversary road trip through the West, an escape from
        the humid misery of a Louisiana summer, Tyson and Adeline
        Maddox rented a glimmering convertible.

        They have kept the top on. It has been too hot to do anything else.
        
        “Reminds me of the engine room,” Mr. Maddox grumbled of the
        weather as he left the “Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas” sign on
        Wednesday evening, when temperatures were still well into triple
        digits.
        
        “The heat, it's just constantly coming,” Ms. Maddox added later.
        “It's like being in front of an exhaust pipe.”
        
        So it has been around the Las Vegas area this week. Pedestrians
        sometimes felt scarcer than jackpots. Playgrounds stood empty
        and silent. Merely walking through a parking lot meant squinting
        — not at the sunlight blanketing the region, but at a heat so
        punishing that eyes hurt without ever actually watering.

        <center><img class="img" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/11/multimedia/11dc-pier-mjzc/11dc-pier-mjzc-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp" alt="">
    <pre>The Biden administration will soon permanently shut down the
        star-crossed $230 million temporary pier that the U.S. military built to
        rush humanitarian aid to Gaza, American officials said on Thursday.

        “I do anticipate that in relatively short order, we will wind down
        pier operations,” Jake Sullivan, President Biden's national security
        adviser, told reporters.
        
        On Wednesday, personnel from the military's Central Command attempted
        and failed to reattach the makeshift pier to the beach in Gaza after
        roughseas forced operators to remove the structure several days ago
        to avoid damage, the Pentagon said.
        
        In a statement, Maj. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary,
        said the latest effort to re-anchor the pier failed because of
        “technical and weather-related issues,” recurring problems that
        The New York Times identified last month when it reported that military officials
        had warned aid organizations that the project could be dismantled as early as July.
